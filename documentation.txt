Problems faced and solved:
1. Date issue: Had to change date format from US to EU because of my system environment. Solved using: https://purplecomputing.com/tech-how-to/microsoft-office/convert-us-dates-to-uk-excel/

2. How to remove filter after replaced values in a column. Fixed using: https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Desktop/Remove-filter-in-Query-Editor/m-p/412625#M189371

Cleaning Steps:
1. Replaced freeform text data in questions containing 'Other(please specify): ...' type answers with just 'Other'. This still keeps the data while ignoring the irrelevant sector for our analysis purposes. First split column by delimiter>removed the split column.

2. For the range of salary: split column by lower and upper range>added new column with calculation of average>deleted the split columns.

3. Created a dashboard using Power BI.
